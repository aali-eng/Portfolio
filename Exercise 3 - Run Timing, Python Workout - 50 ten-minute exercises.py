# For this exercise, then, weâ€™ll assume that you run 10 km each day
# as part of your exercise regime. You want to know how long, on average,
# that run takes. Write a function (run_timing) that asks how long
# it took for you to run 10 km. The function continues to ask how long
# (in minutes) it took for additional runs, until the user presses Enter.
# At that point, the function exits--but only after calculating and
# displaying the average time that the 10 km runs took.
