# Write a function, dictdiff, that takes two dicts as arguments.
# The function returns a new dict that expresses the difference
# between the two dicts. If there are no differences between the dicts,
# dictdiff returns an empty dict. For each key-value pair that differs,
# the return value of dictdiff will have a key-value pair in which the value
# is a list containing the values from the two different dicts. If one of
# the dicts doesnâ€™t contain that key, it should contain None.

        if dict1.get(key) != dict2.get(key):
            output[key] = [dict1.get(key), dict2.get(key)]
