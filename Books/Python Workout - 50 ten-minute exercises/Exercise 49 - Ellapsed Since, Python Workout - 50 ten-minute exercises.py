# In this exercise, write a generator function whose argument must be iterable.
# With each iteration, the generator will return a two-element tuple. The first
# element in the tuple will be an integer indicating how many seconds have passed
# since the previous iteration. The tupleâ€™s second element will be the next item
# from the passed argument. Note that the timing should be relative to the previous
# iteration, not when the generator was first created or invoked. Thus the timing
# number in the first iteration will be 0. You can use time.perf_counter, which
# returns the number of seconds since the program was started. You could use time.time,
# but perf_counter is considered more reliable for such purposes.
